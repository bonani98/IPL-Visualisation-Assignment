# IPL-Visualisation-Assignment
Problem Statement:
The Sports Editor of the agency has approached you to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since 
its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter that their team is working on. For this newsletter, in some 
cases, they will use the visual representations as you have created in Tableau directly for their infographic, and in a few 
other cases, they will use important statistics after trying out the different filters and customisations that you have 
provided for interactivity. Therefore, you are expected to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for this purpose.
Datasets Provided
